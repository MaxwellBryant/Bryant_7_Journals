	System.out.println("What is your name?");
	Scanner heroWeapon = new Scanner(System.in);
	System.out.println("Okay, " + heroName + ", what weapon will you choose: A sword or bow?");

I'm pretty sure somewhere in there I initialized the hero. However, you for sure to not want to initialize it in the class of it would break.

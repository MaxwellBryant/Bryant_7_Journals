Java: public static cubed(int num) { num = 3; return num * num * num; }

Arduino: int number(int x) { return x * x * x; }

Class Student: public class Student() { String test_scores; Student test_scores = new Student; }

1. If we were going to continue with Arduino, I would create a piano. Not exactly all 72 keys, but perhaps one octave in a D Major scale. You could click and hold the note for as long as you want; eventually, you could make a song!

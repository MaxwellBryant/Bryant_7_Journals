I have successfully created a game in which you can grab keys in a specific order and use them to unlock specific doors. I was very happy in knowing that I did that in the very least.

My problem solving process consisted of these steps: 
	1. Search the internet
	2. Ask Mr. Davis
	3. Ask friends
	4. Ask more friends
	5. Ask EVEN MORE friends
	6. Give-up on life until the end of the period

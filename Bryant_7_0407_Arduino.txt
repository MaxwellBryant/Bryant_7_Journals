I have learned much about the concepts of Computer Science. However, there is still much to learn, but what I can tell you is three specific things that I have held the most value for. I have primarily valued arrays and arraylists in Java. They can become a great tool for when you need to make things quickly. Secondly, Object-Oriented Programming is one of the things I loved to do once we started to work on it. The feeling of making a game that you can see animated is a great accomplishment. I primarily in this learned how to add objects into the game and how to declare, instansiate, and initialize these things. Lastly, I have personally learned to light and programm an LED. I feel like this is a cool thing because I wired everything myself from a book. In conclusion, I have truly learned quite a bit from this class!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

1. My plan for the art project is to make the word "Hi" with rectangles and stroked rectangles.

2. The "fillRect" and the "strokeRect" will be mostly what I use along with some positioning.

3. I would stop a loop by specifing what dimensions it should have with the coordinates.

4. For this project I will not have to use "else if" statements.

5. I would have to find the precise places on a grid to properly align the text I plan to create.

1. ELF is an Executable and Linkable Format. This is the standard file format for executables, object code, and libraries.

2. I don't know why I had used "ld". Perhaps it is a compiler for assembly and it stands for something.

3. I do not know why I didn't have to use "chmod" to execute the program.

4. global _start
section .text
_start:
        ; write(1, message, 13)
        mov     rax, 1
        mov     rdi, 1
        mov     rsi, message
        mov     rdx, 44
        syscall

        ; exit(0)
        mov     eax, 60
        xor     rdi, rdi
        syscall

message:
        db      "My name is Maxwell, but you can call me Max.", 10

5. I originally thought that the number after the message was the letter count. I soon found out that it was not the case. So then I talked to Jude and he told me what to do.

6. A low-level language is truly just a language that you have to do EVERYTHING FOR. The computer doesn't do squat, you do it all.

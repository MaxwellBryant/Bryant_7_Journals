1. There are many similar things. For example, "jump". HRM has a jump and Assembly has a "JMP" which basically does the same thing.

2. There are differences such as checking to see if something is true is only in Assembly as I know so far. Now, there most likely will be something like that in HRM, but I have not reached that far in the levels yet.

1. The purpose for the code art that I created was primarily to impress my friends and my brother. My brother has always loved design, like myself, he wants to take-up CS
as well. Secondly, I wanted to avoid conversation by greeting someone without speaking; people will literally walk away from me!
Lastly, I wanted to prove to myself that I can do whatever I can put my mind to, and I did just that.
